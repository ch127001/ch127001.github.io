### How I Got There:

Proud to share the Cisco badge: CCNA Routing & Switching 200-125. Narrowly avoided <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/certpocalypse?lang=en">#Certpocalypse</a> 2020 and thankfully passed the composite exam yesterday morning. With even more thanks owed to David Bombal and Wendell Odom for their unimproveable training materials:

- David Bombal - Your CCNA Start. The Complete Networking Fundamentals course (Udemy)
- David Bombal - Cisco CCNA Packet Tracer Ultimate labs: CCNA 201-301 labs (Udemy)
- Wendell Odom - Cisco Official Cert Guide - CCNA 100-105 (Book 1)
- Wendell Odom - Cisco Official Cert Guide - CCNA Routing and Switching 200-105 (Book 2)
- Quest4.Org - The Art of Subnetting - <a href="http://quest4.org/ccna/subnet_cheat_sheet.htm">The Art of Subnetting and Network Addressing Tips & Tricks</a>


Your Acclaim: <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/users/cjamesni">Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing and Switching (CCNA Routing and Switching) was issued by Cisco to Christopher Evelyn James</a>.
