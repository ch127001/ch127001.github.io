### In and around Chi-town.


Jetlag aside, I'm happy to report ten days, both sunny and enjoyable, on a working visit to Chicago from late April to early May of this year. A great experience which took me from the beautiful Chicago-side shores of Lake Michigan, to many places throughout the 'The Loop' and 'Magnificent Mile' in the city, as well as the suburbs out along Route 59.


### The Chicago Mercantile Exchange & The City Sights


Just a few of the stops along the way:
