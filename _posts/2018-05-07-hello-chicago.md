### In and around Chi-town.



Jet lag aside I'm happy to report ten days both sunny and enjoyable on a working visit to Chicago from late April to early May of this year. A great experience which took me from the beautiful Chicago-side shore of Lake Michigan, to many places throughout The Loop and Magnificent Mile in the city and on out to the suburbs along Route 59.


### The CME Center & Some City Sights.


Just a few of the stops along the way:
