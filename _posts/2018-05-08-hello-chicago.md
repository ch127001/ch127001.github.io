### In and around Chi-town.


Jetlag aside, I'm happy to report ten days, both sunny and enjoyable, on a working visit to Chicago from late April to early May of 2018. A great experience which took me from the Chicago-side shores of Lake Michigan, all throughout the 'Magnificent Mile' and 'The Loop' in the city, and out along Route 59 to the suburbs!
